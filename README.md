## ✨ What is Antigravity-Better-1000X?

**Antigravity-Better-1000X** is a lightweight, zero-dependency toolkit for customizing the AI chat panel in **Antigravity** - Google's new AI-powered IDE.

We provide a **single HTML file** that you can drop into your IDE to unlock powerful customizations - without touching any source code or installing extensions.

You can freely customize this HTML file to build your own features. Following our pre-built framework makes modifications incredibly easy - just add your CSS rules and JS logic, and you're good to go!

> 💡 **Philosophy**: We build the highway; you drive whatever car you want.

### Compatibility Note

- ✅ **Primary Target**: Antigravity (Google's AI IDE)
  - **v0.2.x**: Supports IDE v1.18.3+ (New `workbench.html` architecture)
  - **v0.1.x**: Supports older IDE versions(<1.18.3) (Legacy `cascade-panel.html` architecture)
- ⚠️ **Potentially Compatible**: Other VS Code-based AI IDEs (Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) may work with modifications, but we cannot guarantee compatibility.

## 🚀 Features

### Release Timeline (Partial)

- **v0.2.10**: Fixes the Undo icon rendering issue in conversations by allowing the required Google resources in the Content Security Policy. The fix proposal came from hanliangwei.
- **v0.2.9**: Fixes accidental auto-clicks on conversation titles when creating a new conversation by skipping title buttons that carry both `title` and `grow`.
- **v0.2.8**: Fixes the app version string that was still shown as `0.2.2`, and aligns documentation version info.
- **v0.2.7**: Enhances update checks with dual-source fallback (GitHub API + backup API), shows current/remote version comparison, adds a download entry, and introduces an auto-dismiss system tool for corrupted-install warnings.
- **v0.2.6**: Adds auto-accept rules for diff confirmations and permission prompts, with safer handling for `accept all`, `always allow`, and `allow this conversation`.
- **v0.2.5**: Improves workbench UI, replaces emoji icons with inline SVG, and refines tab alignment, floating settings button, update-check button style, and close-button hit area.
- **v0.2.4**: Fixes LaTeX inline formula rendering issue (#23).
- **v0.2.3**: Adds a deployment tool for `workbench.html`.
- **v0.2.2**: Fixes copy button misalignment and auto-accept click issues, and adds max-click limit with reset.
- **v0.2.1**: Migrates to IDE v1.18.3+ `workbench.html` architecture with v0.1.7 feature parity.
- **v0.1.7**: Stable legacy-architecture release (`cascade-panel.html`).
- **v0.1.6**: Merges auto-retry capability into auto-accept.
- **v0.1.5**: Adds LaTeX formula rendering.
- **v0.1.4**: Adds font-size control and version check.
- **v0.1.3**: Adds safety rules to block dangerous auto-executed commands.
- **v0.1.2**: Adds auto-retry mechanism.
- **v0.1.1**: First core feature set: custom colors, hotkey override, and English support.

### For Developers

## 📦 Installation

### Quick Start

1. **Locate the target file**
   ```
   macOS: /Applications/Antigravity.app/Contents/Resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-browser/workbench/workbench.html
   Windows: [PathToAppFolder]/Antigravity/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-browser/workbench/workbench.html
   ```

2. **Backup & Replace**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to the installation directory
   ## Mac os
   cd /Applications/Antigravity.app/Contents/Resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-browser/workbench/
   ## Windows
   cd [PathToAppFolder]/Antigravity/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-browser/workbench/

   # Backup original
   cp workbench.html workbench.html.bak
   
   # Replace with Antigravity-Better-1000X
   cp /path/to/Antigravity-Better-1000X/app_root/workbench.html ./
   ```

3. **Restart Antigravity** - Done! 🎉

> ⚠️ **Note**: Every time Antigravity updates, it will overwrite the HTML file. You'll need to re-apply this replacement after each update.

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting (Mac OS)

If you encounter a **"File is damaged and should be moved to the Trash"** warning on Mac OS (especially in **v1.20.5**), follow these steps:

1. Click **Cancel** to keep the file.
2. Go to **System Settings** -> **Privacy & Security** -> **Security**.
3. You should see a message saying "Antigravity was blocked...". Click **Allow Anyway** or **Open Anyway**.
4. Open Antigravity again. When the dialog appears, select **Open** (you may need to **right-click** the app and select **Open** instead of using double-click).
5. This only needs to be done once to grant permission.

*Note: We have only tested this on macOS. Other platforms might encounter similar issues; please look for system-specific security permission solutions.*

```
